               the equilibrium relationship between oxygen tension and the
               saturation of haemoglobin. In pharmacology, the Hill equation
               has been extensively used to analyse quantitative drug-receptor
               relationships. Many pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models have
               used the Hill equation to describe nonlinear drug dose-response
               relationships. Although the Hill equation is widely used, its
               many properties are not all well known. This article aims at
               reviewing the various properties of the Hill equation. The
               descriptive aspects of the Hill equation, in particular
               mathematical and graphical properties, are examined, and related
               to Hill's original work. The mechanistic aspect of the Hill
               equation, involving a strong connection with the Guldberg and
               Waage law of mass action, is also described. Finally, a
               probabilistic view of the Hill equation is examined. Here, we
               provide some new calculation results, such as Fisher information
               and Shannon entropy, and we introduce multivariate probabilistic
               Hill equations. The main features and potential applications of
               this probabilistic approach are also discussed. Thus, within the
               same formalism, the Hill equation has many different properties
               which can be of great interest for those interested in
               mathematical modelling in pharmacology and biosciences.",

              when integrated with a pharmacokinetic model, allows
              characterization of the development of functional tolerance. The
              model may be conceived of in several equivalent ways; one of
              these sees tolerance as a result of (noncompetitive) antagonism
              of agonist effect by a hypothetical substance (e.g., metabolite)
              produced by a first-order process, driven by agonist
              concentration. Tolerance thus lags behind, and is approximately
              proportional to, agonist concentrations. Two new parameters
              quantifying tolerance are introduced: kantO, which describes the
              elimination kinetics of the antagonist and determines the rate of
              development and disappearance of tolerance, and Cant50, which
              determines the magnitude of tolerance that can be achieved. The
              model was tested in eight volunteers on data produced after three
              sequences of paired i.v. administrations of nicotine separated by
              different intervals of time. Blood concentrations of nicotine and
              heart rate were measured. The proposed tolerance model was fitted
              to the nicotine data. The estimate of kantO suggests a half-life
              of development and regression of tolerance of 35 min, and the
              estimate of Cant50 suggests that tolerance, at its full
              development, causes an approximately 80\% reduction of initial
              (nontolerant) effect. This model provides a quantitative
              pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic description of the development of
              acute tolerance that also carries physiologic meaning. The
              quantitative information provided by this model may improve
              understanding of the temporal patterns of drug abuse and
              complications thereof.",

               paradigm, a strategy aimed at optimizing the chance of total
               tumor cell eradication, is here questioned. Evidence to date
               suggests that for many tumors the potential for eradication is
               in fact remote, with patients consistently demonstrating tumor
               cell presence subsequent to MTD treatments having eradicative
               intent. The failure to eradicate is attributed largely to the
               heterogeneous nature of the tumor. Heterogeneous cell
               populations demonstrate short-term refractoriness to up-front
               dose delivery, but ``resensitize'' as part of dose recovery,
               showing increased overall susceptibility to a given series of
               doses when delivered more evenly spaced. It is demonstrated: (1)
               that the minimization of total tumor burden, rather than
               complete eradication, may often be the more practical objective;
               and (2) that regularly spaced, ``metronomic'' dosing is the best
               way to achieve it. As a corollary, it is found that the more
               efficient ability of the tumor endothelial cells to resensitize
               following dosing predicts a targeting bias towards the
               endothelial compartment of a tumor when metronomic dosing is
               employed. This lends theoretical support to recent empirical
               studies showing that regularly spaced dosing schedules with no
               extended rest periods act more antiangiogenically, thereby
               delaying or avoiding the onset of acquired resistance.",

  abstract = "The study of the magnitude and variation of drug response is
               defined as pharmacodynamics (PDs). PD models examine plasma
               concentration and effect relationship. It can predict the
               archetypal effect ([Formula: see text]) of a drug as a function
               of the drug concentration ([Formula: see text]) and estimate an
               unknown PD parameter ([Formula: see text]). The PD models have
               been described as fixed, linear, log-linear, [Formula: see
               text], sigmoid [Formula: see text], and indirect PD response.
               Ligand binding model is an example of a PD model that works on
               the underpinning PD principle of a drug, eliciting its
               pharmacological effect at the receptor site. The pharmacological
               effect is produced by the drug binding to the receptor to either
               activate or antagonise the receptor. Ligand binding models
               describe a system of interacting components, i.e. the
               interaction of one or more ligands with one or more binding
               sites. The [Formula: see text] model is the central method that
               provides an empirical justification for the
               concentration/dose-effect relationship. However, for ligand
               binding models justification is provided by theory of receptor
               occupancy. In essence, for ligand binding models, the term
               [Formula: see text] is best used to describe the fraction of
               receptors occupied at a particular ligand concentration. It is
               stated that the [Formula: see text], which means the effect of a
               drug should depend on the fraction of receptors that are
               occupied. In the future, network-based systems pharmacology
               models using ligand binding principles could be an effective way
               of understanding drug-related adverse effects. This will
               facilitate and strengthen the development of rational drug
